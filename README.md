	Detecting fake logos using Neural networks with Keras and Tensorflow based on SURF for image features retrieval

- classification with valid logo classes
- classification with valid and fake logos
- comparing surf impact between full images from the dataset vs cropped images that contain only the logo 

Using dataset flickr_27 from http://image.ntua.gr/iva/datasets/flickr_logos/ 

Run:
- surf_image: to search for features using surf on a given image and plot them
- parse_flickr_27: extract images for a given logo from a folder with multiple images based on a config
- simplify_cfg will remove duplicate images from cfg file and will generate 2 cfg files: train and test (70/30 %)
- rotate_image: rotates an image 90, 180, 270 degrees
- crop: will crop and/or resize images so the image will contain only the logo
- create_more_images: will use rotate_image to generate more images for model training, also updates the data cfg
- train_model: train a model with train data and test it with test data(optional). Keras model will be dumped on disk.
- test_model: test a model with test data (model generated by train_model)
